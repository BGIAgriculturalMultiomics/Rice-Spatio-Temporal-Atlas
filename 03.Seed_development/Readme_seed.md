## seed_trajectory/run_monocle3.r
Single-cell pseudotime analysis. It performs pseudotime trajectory analysis on single-cell RNA-seq data of rice endosperm development, investigating the cell differentiation trajectories at different developmental time points.

## seed_trajectory/cellrank_scVelo.ipynb
Applying CytoTRACE to spatiotemporal transcriptomics data of rice seed development at day 5 for pseudotime analysis, investigating the differentiation trajectories of Starchy_endosperm and Endosperm_adjacent_to_scutellum cell populations.

## seed_plantphoneDB/LRs_dotplots.ipynb
Integrating PlantPhoneDB ligand-receptor interaction results from different developmental stages of seeds and generating bubble plots for visualization.
