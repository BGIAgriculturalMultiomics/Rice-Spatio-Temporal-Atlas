# 🌾 Rice Spatio-Temporal Atlas (RSTA)

**RSTA** is a **multiscale, spatiotemporal integrated research initiative** that spans the entire rice life cycle — *from seed to seed*. It provides a comprehensive, publicly accessible resource for rice functional genomics and breeding.

## 📊 Key Data Resources

The RSTA curates and openly shares five core types of data:

1. **40,155 annotated rice genes**  
2. **788,030 high-quality single nuclei** profiled across **47 distinct tissues**  
3. **Spatial gene expression patterns** mapped in **43 tissue samples**  
4. **Marker genes** defining **202 cell types**  
5. **Analytical and visualization tools** to explore the atlas interactively  

All data are **freely accessible** via a user-friendly web interface, enabling broad scientific use without restriction.

> 💡 **Mission**: To accelerate functional genomics research and enable **genomic-designed breeding** in rice.
