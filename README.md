# Rice-SpatioTemporal-Atlas
Rice Spatio Temporal Atlas (RSTA) is a multiscale spatiotemporal integrated research: from seed to seed. Five aspects of data were curated and provided for public use in the RSTA, which include 1) 40155 annotated genes, 2) 788,030 high-quality single nuclei from 47 tissues, 3) The spatial expression patterns of genes across 43 samples, 4) Markers for 202 cell types, and 5) Tools. 
All the data resources stored in the RSTA are free laccessible through web browser by the public. The RSTA is dedicated to facilitate the functional genomics research and genomic-designed breeding in rice.
